# Cobbler Provider

> The current version of the provider is only compatible with the Cobbler 3.3.x release series. Other versions are
> incompatible.

The Cobbler provider is used to interact with a locally installed [Cobbler](https://cobbler.github.io/) service. The
provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "cobbler" {
  username = var.username # optionally use COBBLER_USERNAME env var
  password = var.password # optionally use COBBLER_PASSWORD env var
  api_url  = var.url      # optionally use COBBLER_URL env var

  # You may need to allow insecure TLS communications unless you
  # have configured certificates
  insecure = var.insecure # optionally use COBBLER_INSECURE env var
}
```
